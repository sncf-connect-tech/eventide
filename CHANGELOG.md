## 1.x.x
* **Restored ETNotSupportedByPlatform** as it was thrown by `createAttendee()` and `removeAttendee()` methods on iOS.
* **Splitted example app** into 3 "use-case" apps

## 1.0.0
* **Breaking Change - Android Permissions:** Removed default calendar permissions from eventide's `AndroidManifest.xml`. Apps must now declare needed permissions based on their usage:
  * `android.permission.READ_CALENDAR` for reading calendars/events
  * `android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR` for creating/modifying calendars/events
  * No permissions required for `createEventInDefaultCalendar()` or `createEventThroughNativePlatform()` (use system Intent)
* **Android Enhancement:** `createEventInDefaultCalendar()` now uses system Intent to open calendar app directly (no permissions needed)
* **New Method:** Added `createEventThroughNativePlatform()` for platform-native event creation
  * iOS: Opens native event creation modal with write-only permission support
  * Android: Uses system calendar app (identical behavior to `createEventInDefaultCalendar()`)
  * All parameters optional for maximum flexibility
  * No permissions required in AndroidManifest.xml or Info.plist
* **Enhanced Exception Handling:** Added new specific exception types:
  * `ETUserCanceledException`: User canceled event creation in native platform
  * `ETPresentationException`: Event creation view cannot be presented
* **Removed Exception:** Removed unused `ETNotSupportedByPlatform` exception
* **Privacy-First Approach:** Enhanced documentation emphasizing user privacy and minimal permission requests
* **Android Bug Fix:** Fixed `allDay` attribute Boolean to Int cast in event creation
* **CI/CD Improvements:** Removed conditional CI jobs for better workflow reliability

## 0.10.2
* **Android fix:** `createEventInDefaultCalendar()` did not retrieve any default calendar when there was multiple primary calendars. Now also returns any writable calendar when there is no primary calendars

## 0.10.1
* **Fixed DateTime UTC handling** in `createEvent()`, `createEventInDefaultCalendar()` and `retrieveEvents()` by systemically calling `dateTime.toUtc()`

## 0.10.0
* **Changed signature of createEventInDefaultCalendar** to not return the created event as the event will not be editable

## 0.9.1
* **Fix** double (write-only and full) permission prompt issue on iOS by creating reminders in the same method channel as the event creation
* **Fix** permission issue on Android by binding PermissionHandler as a RequestPermissionsResultListener
* **Improved docs**

## 0.9.0
* **Removed retrieveDefaultCalendar** because it did not make sense to return a virtual calendar on iOS (error-prone)
* **Created createEventInDefaultCalendar** instead to directly create an event and prompt write-only access on iOS 17+
* **Created .pubignore file** to remove example app and other useless files from being published

## 0.8.1
* **Removed final clause** on Eventide class because it prevented it from being mocked

## 0.8.0
* **iOS 17 Support**: Added support for iOS 17 write-only calendar access
* **Permission Enhancement**: `retrieveDefaultCalendar()` now prompts for write-only access on iOS 17+
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation update with detailed API reference
* **Platform Features**: Added dedicated section for platform-specific features

## 0.7.0
* **Android Calendar Fix**: Fixed calendar creation to use local accounts by default
* **Breaking Change**: `localAccountName` is now mandatory when creating calendars
* **Account Management**: Improved account handling for better calendar organization

## 0.6.0
* **Dependencies**: Removed dependency to [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable)
* **Pigeon Update**: Upgraded pigeon dependency to 25.2.0
* **Requirements**: Set minimum versions - Flutter 3.27.0 & Dart 3.6.0

## 0.5.0
* **Attendees Support**: Retrieve attendees through events (Android & iOS)
* **Attendee Management**: Create/delete attendees (Android only due to iOS EventKit limitations)
* **Development**: Set up lefthook & CI format check
* **Bug Fixes**: Fixed permission checks and configuration issues

## 0.4.0
* **iOS Enhancement**: Added Swift Package Manager support
* **Code Quality**: Updated to Dart 3.7.0 format standards

## 0.3.0
* **Reminders**: Create reminders alongside event creation
* **Bug Fix**: Fixed Android issue where name was incorrectly assigned to type field

## 0.2.0
* **Build Fix**: Resolved Gradle issue by targeting JVM 17
* **New Feature**: Exposed `ETAccount` class with name and type properties ([Issue #8](https://github.com/sncf-connect-tech/eventide/issues/8))
  * iOS: `name` = EKSource.sourceIdentifier, `type` = EKSource.sourceType
  * Android: `name` = CalendarContract.Calendars.ACCOUNT_NAME, `type` = CalendarContract.Calendars.ACCOUNT_TYPE
