### ðŸ”¨ Getting Started

#### Android

Nothing to add on your side. All is already declared in eventide's AndroidManifest.xml

#### iOS

To read/write calendar data, your app must include the following permissions in its info.plist file.

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your calendar to add information about your trip.</string>
<key>NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your calendar to add information about your trip.</string>
<key>NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your calendar to add information about your trip.</string>
```

### ðŸš€ Quick start

```dart
import 'package:eventide/eventide.dart';

final eventide = Eventide();

final calendar = await eventide.createCalendar('Work', Colors.red);

final event = await eventide.createEvent(
    calendarId: calendar.id,
    title: 'Meeting',
    startDate: DateTime.now(),
    endDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
);

final updatedEvent = await eventide.addReminder(
    durationBeforeEvent: Duration(minutes: 15),
    eventId: event.id,
);
```

You can find more in the example app.
